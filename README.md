### Usage

Replace [YOUR_PROFILE_USERNAME] with your profile username, for example: github-profile-views-counter, so the link comes out: https://gpvc.arturio.dev/github-profile-views-counter and afterwards just add it to your profile readme file using code bellow.

GitHub will proxy this url trough github como servers but don't worry, links are correct and cache control is set to no cache, so views will be constantly updated.

```
![Profile views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/[YOUR_PROFILE_USERNAME])
```

![Profile views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/github-profile-views-counter)
